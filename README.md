# Decision-maker-programs
Often times Im reluctant on making decisions, so I just toss a coin or spin a wheel, so that the decision is made for me. But its not always that you have a coin in your pocket or internet to get to pickerwheel.com.
So, as an alternative, Ive made a Coin tosser, Dice roller and Wheel/Random picker in python.
